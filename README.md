Trying to be a relevant person!

Hi, there!

I'm a simple guy trying learn a little about many things, but im not improved in some others, for example, I don't speak english very well.
I'm singer, composer and poetry writer; sometimes I'm try some things in Blender, Gimp, Inkscape, Scribus, Ardour, Audacity, Musescore, LMMS, etc, ever learning and drop out the stress with a big cup of coffee.
Well, for now, thats is good. ;)
